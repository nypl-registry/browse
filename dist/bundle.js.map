The\n\t      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t      Terminology\n\t      -----------\n\t\n\t      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t      itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t      Basic Usage:\n\t      ------------\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t        // on success\n\t        resolve(value);\n\t\n\t        // on failure\n\t        reject(reason);\n\t      });\n\t\n\t      promise.then(function(value) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Advanced Usage:\n\t      ---------------\n\t\n\t      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      function getJSON(url) {\n\t        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t          xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t          xhr.send();\n\t\n\t          function handler() {\n\t            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t              if (this.status === 200) {\n\t                resolve(this.response);\n\t              } else {\n\t                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          };\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      Promise.all([\n\t        getJSON('/posts'),\n\t        getJSON('/comments')\n\t      ]).then(function(values){\n\t        values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t        return values;\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      @class Promise\n\t      @param {function} resolver\n\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t      @constructor\n\t    */\n\t    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\t\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\t\n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n      @param {Function} onRejected\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: lib$es6$promise$then$$default,\n\n    /**\n      `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n      as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\n      ```js\n      function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n      }\n\n      // synchronous\n      try {\n        findAuthor();\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n      }\n\n      // async with promises\n      findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method catch\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      'catch': function(onRejection) {\n        return this.then(null, onRejection);\n      }\n    };\n    var lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$default = lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator;\n    function lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator(Constructor, input) {\n      this._instanceConstructor = Constructor;\n      this.promise = new Constructor(lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop);\n\n      if (Array.isArray(input)) {\n        this._input     = input;\n        this.length     = input.length;\n        this._remaining = input.length;\n\n        this._result = new Array(this.length);\n\n        if (this.length === 0) {\n          lib$es6$promise$$internal$$fulfill(this.promise, this._result);\n        } else {\n          this.length = this.length || 0;\n          this._enumerate();\n          if (this._remaining === 0) {\n            lib$es6$promise$$internal$$fulfill(this.promise, this._result);\n          }\n        }\n      } else {\n        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$reject(this.promise, this._validationError());\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator.prototype._validationError = function() {\n      return new Error('Array Methods must be provided an Array');\n    };\n\n    lib$es6$promise$enumerator$$Enumerator.prototype._enumerate = function() {\n      var length  = this.length;\n      var input   = this._input;\n\n      for (var i = 0;
